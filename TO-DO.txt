To-do:

- [x]  Logic first
- [x]  Then design

- [x]  Calculator
- [x]  Display
- [x]  Button - reusable button components

https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar - <StatusBar barStyle={'light-content'} />

- [x]  +/- operator should negate or opposite the current number-only displayValue
- [x]  % operator should perform a (0.01 * displayValue) and set that as the new state
- [x]  state to remember which operator was selected
- [x]  if pressing two consecutive operators
- [x]  selectedOperator should have change style
- [x]  leftValue doesn’t change if utility buttons pressed half way
- [x]  0 stays at the beginning after ‘AC’ pressed
- [x]  Huge numbers, get to e? or just shrink to fit text
- [x]  Global styles
- [x]  flush the ‘0’ to the left
- [x]  Typing

UNFINISHED To-do items:

- [ ]  AC button turns in to ‘C’ to clear just the previous move? “clear screen” vs “clear memory”
- [ ]  slight animations to operator buttons when changing color
- [ ]  decimal symbol bugs, setDisplayValue(0)
- [ ]  When dividing by 0 (eg. 91 / 0), make ‘Infinity’ display as ‘Error’
